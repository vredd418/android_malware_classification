## Android Malware Classification ##

Android is the mobile platform from Google, and dominates the global market with a 70% share. That translates to roughly 3 billion Android devices that are currently active worldwide. Unfortunately, Android is highly susceptible to malware infection which represents a major problem that's constantly expanding. Android devices represent roughly half of all infected mobile devices, and 87% of Android devices are exposed to at least one critical vulnerability (2.6 billion devices!). As of 2020 around 12,000 new malware instances were discovered each day, and that number has no doubt mushroomed. The financial havoc caused by malware is staggering. Ransomware (a category of malware) alone accounted for $20 billion in damages in 2021, up 57X from 2015. It would not be inaccurate to say that the Android environment experiences an assault from malware.

Android malware falls into dozens categories, some of which are well known. For example, everybody has dealt with unwanted ads popping up on their screen. Those ads are generated by Adware, unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser.  Ransomware is a type of malware that threatens to publish the victim's personal data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. Trojan is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. There are many more categories, each category made up of sub-categories, and new malware instances popping up each day that are unidentified.

My aim in this project was to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis
